Hi, I’m Sam.

I acquired a certification in Computer Programming from UCSC Silicon Valley.
My professional background is in photography and filmmaking/video production, but my
interest in coding has blossomed from a hobby to a burgeoning career over the last
8-9 years. I build physical computing projects and games for fun.

In school I studied C, C++, C#, and Python. I’m really interested in embedded systems,
physical computing, VR, and Human Computer Interaction (HCI).

I am currently a SWE at Lyft.

Don't hesitate to reach out to me at me@samfriedman.tech

A portfolio of my completed projects is at:
