Hi, I’m Sam.

I recently acquired a certification in Computer Programming from UCSC Silicon Valley.
My professional background is in photography and filmmaking/video production, but my
interest in coding has blossomed from a hobby to a burgeoning career over the last
8-9 years. I build physical computing projects and games for fun.

In school I studied C, C++, C#, and Python. I’m really interested in embedded systems,
VR, and Human Computer Interaction (HCI). At the moment I'm working on getting my first
coding job.

Don't hesitate to reach out to me at me@samfriedman.tech
